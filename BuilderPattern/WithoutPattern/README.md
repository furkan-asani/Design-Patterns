# This is the example without the usage of the builder pattern
SOLID Violations:
* Violates Single Responsibility Principle
    * Building and representing are separate concerns
* Violates Dependency Inversion Principle
    * Main class depends on the concrete computer implementation

Another hint of bad code:
* Long parameterlist

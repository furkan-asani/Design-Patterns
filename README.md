# What is this repository for?

This repository is created with the intention of revisiting the core concepts of SOLID and the widely used Design Patterns which were made famous by the Gang of Four.
There is a folder for every pattern and within the respective folder there is always a version with and without the usage of the specific pattern. This shall make it easier to see the differences and advantages of using those principles in order to avoid making those mistakes in the future.
